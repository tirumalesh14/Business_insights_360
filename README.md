Business 360 Insights
Domain: Strategic Business Analysis
Project Title: Business 360 Insights for AtliQ Mart
Company: AtliQ Mart â€“ A growing FMCG company in Gujarat (Vadodara, Surat, Ahmedabad)
Stakeholders: Director, Head of Business Strategy

Background
AtliQ Mart, a reputed FMCG player, is currently operational in three major cities of Gujarat and aims to scale operations into other metro and Tier-1 cities. To enable this expansion and ensure data-driven decisions, the leadership is focused on enhancing visibility across key business functions like Sales, Finance, Operations, and Customer Relations.

Challenge
While AtliQ Mart has access to various siloed data sources, it lacks a consolidated view of business performance. Department heads find it difficult to draw actionable insights due to fragmented reporting formats and lagging metrics. The leadership team wants a centralized 360-degree business dashboard to view performance holistically, spot trends, uncover inefficiencies, and make proactive decisions.

My Role
As a newly onboarded Business Analyst, I have been tasked with leading the design, development, and deployment of an insightful Business 360 Dashboard. This dashboard should bring together critical KPIs from various departments, providing a single version of the truth for stakeholders.

My Task
Build a Business 360 Dashboard using tools like Power BI/Tableau.

Incorporate department-specific KPIs and create drill-down functionalities.

Identify cross-functional trends and hidden patterns in the data.

Present business insights and strategic recommendations.

Ensure dashboard is interactive, intuitive, and executive-friendly.
